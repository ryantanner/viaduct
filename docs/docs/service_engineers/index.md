description: Operating a Viaduct instance.
---

The Service Engineers section is for those responsible for operating and configuring a Viaduct instance—as opposed to developing tenant modules that run on it. While the Developers section covers writing resolvers, defining schemas, and building GraphQL features, this section addresses infrastructure and operational concerns.

As a service engineer, you manage the Viaduct service itself: configuring how tenant modules are composed, setting up monitoring and alerting, defining application-wide policies, and extending the schema with shared types and directives. You bridge the gap between individual tenant teams and the underlying platform, ensuring the GraphQL API performs reliably at scale.

If you're building features within a Viaduct application, start with the [Developers](../developers/index.md) section instead. Come back here when you need to configure the Viaduct instance itself or set up operational tooling.
