description: Set up your first Viaduct application
---

This section will guide you through setting up your first Viaduct tenant and understanding the core concepts of the framework. You'll start by configuring your development environment—either by cloning an existing tenant or creating one from scratch—then take a tour of the codebase structure. The Star Wars tutorial walks you through building a complete GraphQL API, covering schemas, resolvers, directives, mutations, and testing. By the end of this section, you'll have a working Viaduct tenant and the foundational knowledge to build and extend your own GraphQL services.

## What's Next

Continue to [Project Setup](setup/index.md) to understand the structure of a Viaduct application.
