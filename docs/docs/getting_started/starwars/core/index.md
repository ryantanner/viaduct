title: Core Concepts
description: Viaduct core concepts applied in the Star Wars demo application.
---


This section explains how Viaduct’s core building blocks map onto the Star Wars demo application. It provides a
shared vocabulary for the rest of the docs and links out to deeper explanations where needed.

## What “core” means here

Core refers to the foundational pieces that every Viaduct service uses: schemas, resolvers, scopes, global IDs,
batching, and validation. The Star Wars demo uses minimal, in-memory data to make these concepts easy to see and
adapt to real backends later.

## Topics in this section

- Global IDs
- Node Resolvers
- Field Resolvers
- Batch Resolvers
- Resolver Integration Patterns
