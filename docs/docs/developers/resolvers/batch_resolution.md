title: Batch Resolution
description: Batch node and field resolvers
---


Both [node resolvers](node_resolvers.md) and [field resolvers](field_resolvers.md) can be implemented using the `batchResolve` function. This provides an alternative to the widely used [data loader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader) pattern.

## The N+1 problem

Consider this example schema:

```graphql
type Query {
  recommendedListings: [Listing] @resolver
}

type Listing implements Node {
  id: ID!
  title: String
}
```

Suppose the query below returns 3 recommended listings. A `Listing` node resolver that makes a call to a listings service to fetch a single listing in the `resolve` function will result in 3 separate calls to the service.

```graphql
query {
  recommendedListings {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

This is the N+1 problem, which is commonly solved by implementing a data loader that batches calls to the listings service. The resolver calls the data loader, which then calls the data source.

## batchResolve

In Viaduct, you can implement the `batchResolve` function and directly call the data source instead of going through a data loader. Under the hood, Viaduct still uses a data loader to batch requests. However, this data loader is part of Viaduct's framework, not something that application developers need to write and maintain. Here's an example `Listing` batch node resolver:

```kotlin
@Resolver
class ListingNodeResolver @Inject constructor(val client: ListingClient) : NodeResolvers.Listing() {
  override suspend fun batchResolve(contexts: List<Context>): List<FieldValue<Listing>> {
    val listingIDs = contexts.map { it.id.internalID }
    val responses = client.fetch(listingIDs)

    return contexts.map { ctx ->
      val listingID = ctx.id.internalID
      val response = responses[listingID]
      FieldValue.ofValue(
        Listing.Builder(ctx)
          .title(response.title)
          .build()
      )
    }
  }
}
```

### Input

`batchResolve` takes a list of `Context` objects as input. This is the same `Context` object type passed to the non-batching `resolve` function. Viaduct's GraphQL execution engine batches these contexts before passing them to the `batchResolve` function.

### Output

The list that `batchResolve` returns must have the same number of elements as the input list. Each output value corresponds to the input `Context` at the same list index.

#### FieldValue

Notice that the output list elements are wrapped in {{ kdoc("viaduct.api.FieldValue") }} (e.g., `List<FieldValue<Listing>>` in the example above). This represents either a successfully resolved value or an error value.

**Usage:**
* `FieldValue.ofValue(v)`: constructs a successfully resolved value, as shown in the example above
* `FieldValue.ofError(e)`: constructs an error value, where `e` is an exception. The corresponding value in the GraphQL response will be null, and there will be an error in the errors array.

### When to use `batchResolve`

Override `batchResolve` whenever you need to fetch data from an external data source that supports batch loading. This solves the N+1 problem and similar issues where multiple parts of a GraphQL query fetch data that can be batched together.

If your resolver does not have external data dependencies, there is generally no benefit to implementing `batchResolve`.

Those familiar with data loaders may know that they also provide an intra-request cache. In Viaduct, this memoization cache is decoupled from batching, so you do not need to implement `batchResolve` for caching purposes.
