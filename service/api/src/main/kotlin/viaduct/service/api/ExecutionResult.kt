/**
 * The result of executing a GraphQL operation through Viaduct.
 *
 * This is a Viaduct-specific wrapper that does not expose GraphQL Java types directly.
 * The structure of [getData] directly reflects the query provided in [ExecutionInput.operationText].
 *
 * ## Data and Errors Relationship
 *
 * - If [getData] returns `null`, [errors] will contain at least one error explaining why
 * - If [getData] returns data, [errors] may still contain errors for fields that failed (partial results)
 *
 * ## Partial Results (GraphQL Spec §6.4.4)
 *
 * GraphQL supports partial results: if a nullable field encounters an error, it returns `null`
 * but execution continues. The error is recorded in [errors] while other fields retain their data.
 * Only errors in non-nullable fields cause null to bubble up to parent fields.
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * Given this query in [ExecutionInput.operationText]:
 * ```graphql
 * query {
 *   user(id: "123") {
 *     name
 *     posts { title }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * [getData] returns:
 * ```kotlin
 * mapOf(
 *   "user" to mapOf(
 *     "name" to "Alice",
 *     "posts" to listOf(mapOf("title" to "First Post"))
 *   )
 * )
 * ```
